## Dev environment
To set up a convenient dev environment run this at the root:

```bash
    npm install .
    npm install -g gulp
```

Then run

```
    gulp
```

Gulp is a javascript task runner. It compiles sass, lints the compiled css, and sets up a livereload server so you can save your fingers from pressing âŒ˜+r

* Once you add & commit files you are ready to publish run:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Rake tasks

Start sass development - watches the sass folder and updates css/i.css with every file change
```bash
rake sass
```

Start sass - output is minified to css/i.css
```bash
rake minify
```
